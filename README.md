3D Unity mobile game project named "Zootopia" was developed during our long-term internship at Marker Games. The development was undertaken by me and a teammate. It is an arcade idle game. In this game, set on an animal farm, a player manage the operations where customers visit animals by passing through a reception and paying money. Customers queue up in front of the reception and visit the animal rooms as spaces become available. The customers feed the animals, purchase various souvenirs, and then leave. The player takes on the role of the manager of this establishment, overseeing all operations and addressing any deficiencies in the facility. For instance, the player cleans dirty animal rooms, renews souvenirs, and can open new animal rooms and call helpers as they earn money.


I developed,
1. Queue Structure(Line up of customers in front of the reception)
2. Creating customers with different outfits,
3. Opening new animal rooms, and renovating rooms
4. Dirt and cleaning rooms
5. Renovating animal feeders and gifts as they run out
6. Customers first go to the animal rooms, wait there for the animation to
start, then there is a fifty percent chance that they will go to the gift
rooms, pick up the gifts and return to the exit.
7. I used a lot of Singleton Structures
8. I used a lot of Unity Events
