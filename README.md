# S01-Zootopia

During our long-term internship at Marker Games, I developed a 3D Unity mobile game project called "Zootopia" with a teammate. In this game, which takes place on an animal farm, players manage operations where customers visit animals by paying when their turn comes at the reception. In addition, the player cleans dirty animal rooms, renews souvenirs, and can open new animal rooms and call helpers as they earn money.
